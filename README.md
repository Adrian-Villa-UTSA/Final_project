Attack Detected Distribution:
    What is the distribution of detected attacks (attack_detected)? 
        The distribution of detected attacks shows how many sessions had attacks (attack_detected = 1) versus no attacks (attack_detected = 0). Most sessions likely have no attacks, but a significant number with attacks highlights the need for stronger intrusion detection systems to monitor and respond to threats effectively.

    How can businesses use this information to allocate resources for intrusion detection?
        Businesses can use this information to allocate resources for intrusion detection by identifying patterns in attack distribution, login attempts, and protocol vulnerabilities. For example, if a significant number of sessions have detected attacks, businesses should invest in real-time monitoring tools and automated response systems to handle threats effectively.


Login Attempts:

    How do login attempts differ between sessions with and without detected attacks?
        Sessions without detected attacks: Typically have fewer login attempts, with most values clustered around the lower range.
        Sessions with detected attacks: Tend to have significantly higher login attempts, indicating potential brute force attacks. Outliers in these sessions suggest extreme cases of repeated login attempts.

    Are there any thresholds or patterns in login attempts that indicate a higher likelihood of an attack?
        Thresholds: Sessions with detected attacks (attack_detected = 1) tend to have significantly higher login attempts compared to sessions without attacks (attack_detected = 0). This suggests that a high number of login attempts could be a threshold for identifying potential brute force attacks.

        Patterns:Sessions with no attacks (attack_detected = 0) generally have login attempts clustered in the lower range. Sessions with attacks (attack_detected = 1) show a wider range of login attempts, with outliers indicating extreme cases of repeated login attempts.


Protocol Type:

    Which protocol types are most associated with detected attacks?
        The bar chart of attack rates by protocol_type shows the proportion of sessions with detected attacks for each protocol type.  Protocol with higher attack rates are most associated with detected attacks. Protocols like TCP and UDP are often targeted due to their widespread use in network communication.


    How can businesses prioritize securing specific protocols based on attack rates?
        Businesses can priorotize securing specific protocols by analyzing the attack rates for each protocol type. From the bar chart of attack rates by protocol_type:
            Identify High-Risk Protocols: Protocols with the highest attack rates (e.g., TCP, UDP) should be prioritized for enhanced security measures.

            Implement Security Measures:Encryption: Use encryption protocols like TLS for securing high-risk protocols (e.g., TCP traffic).
            Firewall Rules: Apply strict firewall rules to limit access to vulnerable protocols.
            Traffic Monitoring: Continuously monitor traffic on high-risk protocols for anomalies or suspicious activity.

            Focus on Niche Protocols: Protocols with low session counts but high attack rates may represent niche vulnerabilities. Investigate and secure these protocols to prevent exploitation.
